# Dynamic selection of databases, e.g. USER_DATABASES.

# Database state check. If a database is not online the procedure logs the database state and continues to the next database.

# Robust error handling and logging. If an error occurs the procedure logs the error and continues to the next database or index. 
In the end the job reports failure. Information about all commands are logged with start time, command text, command output and end time.
